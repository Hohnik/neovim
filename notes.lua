  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --
  --
  -- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
  -- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
  --    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
  --
  -- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
  --
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  --
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VimEnter'
  --
  -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  --
  -- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded:
  --  config = function() ... end

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
  --
  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

  -- `build` is used to run some command when the plugin is installed/updated.
  -- This is only run then, not every time Neovim starts up.
  -- `cond` is a condition used to determine whether this plugin should be
  -- installed and loaded.
  -- Telescope is a fuzzy finder that comes with a lot of different things that
  -- it can fuzzy find! It's more than just a "file finder", it can search
  -- many different aspects of Neovim, your workspace, LSP, and more!
  --
  -- The easiest way to use Telescope, is to start by doing something like:
  --  :Telescope help_tags
  --
  -- After running this command, a window will open up and you're able to
  -- type in the prompt window. You'll see a list of `help_tags` options and
  -- a corresponding preview of the help.
  --
  -- Two important keymaps to use while in Telescope are:
  --  - Insert mode: <c-/>
  --  - Normal mode: ?
  --
  -- This opens a window that shows you all of the keymaps for the current
  -- Telescope picker. This is really useful to discover what Telescope can
  -- do as well as how to actually do it!

  -- NOTE: Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
  --
  -- LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
  --
  -- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
  -- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
  --
  -- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
  -- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
  -- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
  -- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
  --
  -- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
  --  - Go to definition
  --  - Find references
  --  - Autocompletion
  --  - Symbol Search
  --  - and more!
  --
  -- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
  -- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
  --
  -- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
  -- and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`

  --  This function gets run when an LSP attaches to a particular buffer.
  --    That is to say, every time a new file is opened that is associated with
  --    an lsp (for example, opening `main.rs` is associated with `rust_analyzer`) this
  --    function will be executed to configure the current buffer

  -- NOTE: Remember that Lua is a real programming language, and as such it is possible
  -- to define small helper and utility functions so you don't have to repeat yourself.
  --
  -- In this case, we create a function that lets us more easily define mappings specific
  -- for LSP related items. It sets the mode, buffer and description for us each time.
  map = function(keys, func, desc)
    vim.keymap.set('n', keys, func, { buffer = event.buf, desc = 'LSP: ' .. desc })
  end,

  -- LSP servers and clients are able to communicate to each other what features they support.
  --  By default, Neovim doesn't support everything that is in the LSP specification.
  --  When you add nvim-cmp, luasnip, etc. Neovim now has *more* capabilities.
  --  So, we create new capabilities with nvim cmp, and then broadcast that to the servers.

  -- Enable the following language servers
  --  Feel free to add/remove any LSPs that you want here. They will automatically be installed.
  --
  --  Add any additional override configuration in the following tables. Available keys are:
  --  - cmd (table): Override the default command used to start the server
  --  - filetypes (table): Override the default list of associated filetypes for the server
  --  - capabilities (table): Override fields in capabilities. Can be used to disable certain LSP features.
  --  - settings (table): Override the default settings passed when initializing the server.
  --        For example, to see the options for `lua_ls`, you could go to: https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/
